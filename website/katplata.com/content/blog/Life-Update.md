## Today I turn 26 
And I lose all of my parent's healthcare benefits. 
I also lose my awesome unlimited stand-by flying benefit.
Some of the countries I've visited this year and last include:  </br>
- Argentina x 2 </br>
- Poland </br>
- Japan </br>
- France x 3 </br>
- Germany </br>
- Philippines </br>
- Vietnam </br>
- Turkey </br>
- Mexico </br>

## New Job </br>
On top of aging out of some cushy benefits, I'm also embarking on a new role at work that will allow me to move away from Java development and being a Scrum Master to mashing keys away in Python!
