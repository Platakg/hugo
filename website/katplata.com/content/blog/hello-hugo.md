Since I have a few hours before my flight to Hanoi, I figured I have enough time to write a post and grab some food. About an hour ago I woke up at the Singapore Changi airport and thought to write a post on how I used Hugo to create this site. 

<a href="https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/"> Hugo </a> is a static site generator that can be hosted anywhere (I'm using an S3 bucket). You can use CLI commands to create new websites and posts, or use your preferred text editor.


## Step 1. Install Hugo via Homebrew
This is the easiest way to install hugo. If you don't have homebrew already installed, check out <a href="/blog/first-post"> this post.</a> <br>

### Run: 
"brew install hugo"<br>
<br>
To verify installtion
### Run:
"hugo version"
Currently, I am using v0.49.2

## Step 2. Create a workspace directory:
Create a new workspace folder for where you will be saving all of your site's files!<br>
<br>
Once you've created your directory, make sure you "git init" to initialize this as a git repo. 

## Step 3.  Create a New Site: 
Hugo sites are composed of a parent directory and many sub directories denoting the site's structure. Among the sub directories is your config file. For this site, I am using a config.toml file (<a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml"> Tom's Obvious Minimal Language </a>), this file will serve as the "template" for your site and will contain important information such as your base URL and tab information.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/"> Hugo's Documentation for Config files (.yaml, .toml, .json examples also available)</a>

### Run:
"hugo new site my-new-site"

This is will automatically create a new site template called "my-new-site", containing the necessary sub directories (archetypes, content, layouts, themes, data, static) and config file. <br>

## Step 4. Choose a Theme:
This is the fun part! Head over to the hugo themes <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io"> site. </a> <br>

Once you've selected the theme you'd like, hit the download link on the theme's page. You will be re-directed to the themes' github page. <br>
For me, I prefer to clone the theme right into the "themes" directory (my-new-site/themes/[theme name]).

In order to do this, navigate to the "themes" directory from the root of your site directory. <br>
<br>
Following the example above: the path will look like "my-new-site/themes/" <br>
<br>
Once inside the "themes" directory, run "git clone [web URL to git repo]" <br>

ex: git clone https://github.com/tomanistor/osprey.git

## Step 5. Copy the Config File:
Navigate to "my-new-site/themes/[theme name]/ <br>
<br>
A config file will appear as either a .toml or .yaml file, copy this file and "cd.." back into your Hugo site's root directory and replace the pre-existing "config.toml" file. 

## Step 6. Write a Post:
Some themes are structured differently from others, so it's always worthwhile to read your theme's ReadMe file. <br>
<br>
To create your first post:
### Run:
"hugo new posts/first-post.md" 
<br>

This will create a post called "first-post" under the "content" subdirectory. 
From here you can follow your normal markdown/HTML syntax in order to write content for your post inside of a text editor (I'm using VS Code)

## Step 7. Host your Site Locally:
As you're editing your site, play around with different keys in the config file. <br>
You can actually view your changes as your editing and saving in your editor. <br>

<br>
To start the Hugo server: 
### Run:
"hugo server" 
<br>
<br>
Once you've ran the command succesfully, you will be able to navigate to "localhost:1313" on your web browser of choice to see your changes.
