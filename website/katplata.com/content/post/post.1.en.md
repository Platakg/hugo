26 October 2018 <br>

I just treated myself to a new Macbook pro. My old MacBook was getting too bulky for my taste and starting to show signs of clunking out. I don't anticipate on buying another machine for the next 5 years, but I'd like outline my set up for when that day comes. 

(Sidenote: I'm currently awaiting my departing flight from SFO to SIN. In anticipation for this 16+ hour flight, I'd like to get this done so that I have something to play around with!)
