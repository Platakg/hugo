Since I have a few hours before my flight to Hanoi, I figured I have enough time to write a post and grab some food. About an hour ago I woke up at the Singapore Changi airport and thought to write a post on how I used Hugo to create this site. 

<a href="https://gohugo.io/about/what-is-hugo/"> Hugo </a> is a simple to use static site generator that can be hosted anywhere. You can use CLI commands to create new websites and posts, or use your preferred text editor.

<ul> Install Hugo via Homebrew: <br>
This is the easiest way to install hugo. If you don't have homebrew already installed, check out <a href="/post/post1"> this post.</a> <br>
Run <i> "brew install hugo" </i> in your terminal to install Hugo.
</ul>

<ul> Verify Installation: <br>
Run <i> "hugo version" </i>  to verify the version of Hugo you have just installed. <br>
Currently, I am using v0.49.2 <br>
</ul>

<ul> Create a New Site: <br>
Hugo sites are made up of a parent directory and multiple sub-directories to include the config.toml configuration file. <br>
The command below will create a new Hugo site folder called "my-new-site" <br>
Run <i> "hugo new site my-new-site" </i>
</ul>

<ul> Select a Theme 
</ul>

<ul> Add Content to Your New Site 
</ul>

<ul> Use a Text Editor
</ul>

<ul> View Your Site Locally
</ul>

<ul> Host Your Site
</ul>
