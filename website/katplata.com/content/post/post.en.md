Hi. I'm a data scientist and software developer interested in <b>many things</b>. 

I studied economics and data analysis during my undergrad but somehow ended up in the tech space. Computer vision, network analysis, and visualization are among the myriad of topics that catch my interest--along with traveling, shopping, and eating cookies! 

I tend to jump around when it comes to learning new tools, languages, etc. so I plan to use this space to journal what I've learned from my tinkerings.
