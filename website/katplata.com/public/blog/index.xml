      <description>Since I have a few hours before my flight to Hanoi, I figured I have enough time to write a post and grab some food. About an hour ago I woke up at the Singapore Changi airport and thought to write a post on how I used Hugo to create this site.
Hugo  is a static site generator that can be hosted anywhere (I&amp;rsquo;m using an S3 bucket). You can use CLI commands to create new websites and posts, or use your preferred text editor.</description>

      <description>I just treated myself to a new Macbook pro. My old MacBook was getting too bulky for my taste and starting to show signs of clunking out. I don&amp;rsquo;t anticipate to buy a new machine for the next 5 years, so I&amp;rsquo;d like outline my set up for when that day comes.
(Sidenote: I&amp;rsquo;m currently awaiting my departing flight from SFO to SIN. In anticipation for this 16+ hour flight, I&amp;rsquo;d like to get this done so that I have something to play around with!</description>
