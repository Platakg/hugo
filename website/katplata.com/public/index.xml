      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist and wanderer interested in many things.
I studied economics and data analysis during my undergrad but somehow ended up in the tech space. Computer vision, network analysis, and visualization are among the myriad of topics that catch my interest&amp;ndash;along with traveling and shopping!
I tend to jump around when it comes to learning new tools, languages, etc. so I plan to use this space to journal what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from my tinkerings.</description>

      <description>Since I have a few hours before my flight to Hanoi, I figured I have enough time to write a post and grab some food. About an hour ago I woke up at the Singapore Changi airport and thought to write a post on how I used Hugo to create this site.
Hugo  is a static site generator that can be hosted anywhere (I&amp;rsquo;m using an S3 bucket). You can use CLI commands to create new websites and posts, or use your preferred text editor.</description>

      <description>I just treated myself to a new Macbook pro. My old MacBook was getting too bulky for my taste and starting to show signs of clunking out. I don&amp;rsquo;t anticipate to buy a new machine for the next 5 years, so I&amp;rsquo;d like outline my set up for when that day comes.
(Sidenote: I&amp;rsquo;m currently awaiting my departing flight from SFO to SIN. In anticipation for this 16+ hour flight, I&amp;rsquo;d like to get this done so that I have something to play around with!</description>
